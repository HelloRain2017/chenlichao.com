<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat>

Netcat is a computer networking service for *reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP* . Netcat is designed to be a dependable "back-end" device that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and investigation tool, since it can produce almost any kind of correlation you would need and has a number of built-in capabilities.

Netcat is often referred to as a "Swiss-army knife for TCP/IP". Its list of features includes port scanning, transferring files, and port listening, and it can be used as a backdoor.
